# Alex's tips n' tricks
Here's a quick braindump of useful stuff that I've found useful over the years. Will be continuously added to as the event goes on

## General

- If you're stuck picking between a bunch of passives that are all functionally the same (i.e 30 different types of capacitors), start with the CAD and work backwards - it'll help you get an idea of which one would physically look the best.
- If you're building a 3D printer, [infill](https://infill.hackclub.com) was a 3D printer YSWS that ran recently. There's a TON of resources on the website!

## Technical resources
- Adafruit projects are extremely good for looking at what's behind-the-scenes of hardware projects

## Software
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is an awesome site for making really quick sketches that look good
