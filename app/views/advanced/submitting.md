# Submitting your project!

If you're done your project, here's how to submit! Please read carefuly.

Before you submit anything, you should post your project in #highway for feedback! That way, you can make your project as good as it can be before submitting

## Requirements

Before submitting, please *absolutely* make sure of the following:

- **Your project has a journal in the [gallery](/projects)**
- **Your GitHub repository has all of your project files:**
    - a BOM, in CSV format in the root directory
    - the source files for your PCB, if you have one
    - the source files for your CAD model, if you have one
    - ANY other files that are part of your project.
- **In your GitHub README.md file:**
    - A description of what your project is
    - A couple sentences on *why* you made the project
    - **PICTURES OF YOUR PROJECT**
        - A screenshot of a full 3D model with your project
        - A screenshot of your PCB, if you have one
    - A wiring diagram, if you're doing any wiring that isn't on a PCB
    - A BOM in table format at the end of the README
- **In your GitHub JOURNAL.md file:**

        - Date written
        - Time spent

## Submitting your final build

Finished building your project IRL? 

Two things you need to do:

1. Post a demo on Reddit! Here's an [example of a post by @cyao](https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/1kwx5p7/i_built_the_fpga_raspberry_pi_zero_equivalent/).
2. For those who made a custom project - make a magazine page for it! Instructions on this [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/JrUtKGmZKVaT8t2z12oybV/magazine-?node-id=0-1&t=qPMHT9OHuyUDMGj8-1) - we're going to physically print out a magazine, where each page has a project on it.

Then, fill out the [Demo Form](https://forms.hackclub.com/highway-demo) - we'll look at it in a few days and let you know if it's been approved!
