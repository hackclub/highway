# Sourcing parts

Welcome to part sourcing! Here's a ton of tips for you to optimize your part selection & costs!

If you're ever unsure of your BOM, send it in #highway! People can definitely help you pick better parts and make better decisions.

## Overview
When picking parts, PLEASE be resourceful! Make the most out of every dollar and don't take the entire budget just because you can

#### Do's

- Lots of research into what parts to use!
- Ask in #highway for advice on picking parts

#### Don'ts

- Buy a $100 Oscilloscope
- Buy extra parts for "later projects"
- Buy a $40 module on amazon instead of waiting 2 weeks to get it for $5 instead

At the end, everything should be in a BOM with links to specific parts.


## Specific parts

### General

Generally speaking, try to reference parts off of other projects since you'll eliminate more unknowns with the hardware

### Modules (TP4056, LED matrices, etc)

Almost always the cheapest option is to get it from AliExpress; the only downside is that shipping *may* take awhile - usually a 2-3 week buffer is safe.

If you're in a pinch, Amazon actually has OK prices all things considered. I would avoid it though unless you're going to miss Undercity if you don't

### SBCs (Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, etc)
Raspberry Pi
You can get Orange Pis from aliexpress.

Depending on your application though, you can also repurpose old laptops/desktops for your specific application if it's not space-sensitive

### Microcontrollers (arduino, RP2040, etc)
AliExpress is still usually your go-to for this! 

Arduinos are fairly outdated by todays standards

### PCBs

- If you're in India, use SEEED. They take HCB cards and are by far the cheapest option
- If you're from another country, use JLCPCB, they offer pcbs for under $6 shipped as long as its under 100x100mm
- If you're from the US specifically, use PCBWAY. They're roughly half the cost of JLCPCB because they're able to avoid tarrifs somehow

### Batteries (Li-Po, CR2032, AA, etc)

## Specific countries

### India:
- Most vendors do not take int'l cards, which unfortunately HCB falls into the category of. Contact your local vendors to try to get that changed!

## Tips for specific vendors

### AliExpress
aliexpress is one of the highest skill ceiling stores out there - there's a ton of optimization you can do. Here's some tips:

- The welcome deal only works once when you make your account, so don't budget off of that - you will be hit by significantly higher prices afterwards.
- Pay attention to the estimate shipment date. This will vary by region, but generally speaking it's actually fairly reliable
- Also pay attention to the shipping cost! Usually items that don't have free shipping but a lower initial price actually end up being more expensive when you tally the costs
- There's specific vendors that are useful:
    - AITXEM ROBOT: Any microcontroller you can think of
    - Trianglelab: 3D printer parts!
