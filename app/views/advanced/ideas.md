# Getting project ideas

Brainstorming can be *really* hard - here's some help on coming up with ideas!

*this document will be updated as the event runs*

### From Hack Club
Here's a list of ideas that we personally think would be cool to make!

***Really* cool ideas**

- Your own custom hacker badge to bring to the event! (reference [here](https://github.com/badger/home))
- Devboards! (ESP32, CHV32v307, NRF52840, etc)
- Claw machine for prizes
- PCB Mill
- Protogen head
- Feel free to add more suggestions!

**Less cool** (but still cool!!)

- 3D printer mods
- 2D plotter
- PCB Hotplate

Doing these does *not* guarantee your project will be approved! There's still a minimum quality bar for each project

### General tips
Here's some more general tips for coming up with ideas:

- Adafruit has a ton of awesome projects - you can't copy them directly, but you're more than free to take inspo from them
- Do a lot of sketching! Putting stuff down on paper helps a *lot* with thinking since you don't have to come up with it all in your head
