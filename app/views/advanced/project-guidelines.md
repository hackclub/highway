# Project Guidelines

If you're wondering what you're allowed to build, the bottom line is this:

Build something *awesome*, something that you would be proud to keep in your room for the next 5 years, and something that you would be proud to show other people.

Let's get teenagers to be the ones to make the best projects yet.

## Overview
Here's an overall list of what is allowed / isn't allowed for your project! Keep in mind these are just guidelines

Generally speaking, each project must be closer to a product than a demo - that doesn't mean go ultra advertising mode, but that does mean that a breadboarded together project with no case *doesn't* count

I want to make it clear that there is **no** idea

For the sake of this guide, we're going to use

### Complexity
A custom project should include each of the following:

- A case / cover / some sort of physical part
- A custom PCB (unless you REALLY don't need it)
- Ideally some sort of software config / cronjob / tool that is beyond the defaults of whatever you're using

### Originality

Almost every idea out there has been thought of before - what matters is that when designing it, which means that you do *not* do the following:

- Directly copy paste schematics
- Directly copy paste layouts
- Directly copy paste entire programs
- Directly copy paste 3D printed / manufactured models (reference parts are OK)
- **In general, do not copy paste stuff directly - use them as references**


## Examples
**Here are some examples of great projects by Hack Clubbers:**

- @Ducc's <a href="https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay/" target="_blank">Spotify Display</a>, a Spotify Car Thing Clone
- @Cyao's <a href="https://github.com/cheyao/icepi-zero" target="_blank">Icepi Zero</a>, an FPGA development dev board
- @vk6's <a href="https://github.com/ading2210/ender-x4" target="_blank">Ender X4</a>, a 4-toolhead 3D printer

**Here are some examples of what *not* to build:**

- Arduino alarm clock
- Humidity display
- Distance sensor

**Here's some examples of how you could make those projects better:**

- Arduino alarm clock, but it has custom LED lighting that syncs with the time of day & also has a slide switch instead of a button to control it
- A humidity display that's part of a larger weather station setup and compares the internal readings of your house to the outside world 
- A distance sensor that checks if someone is coming to your room & sends an alert to your phone if they do
