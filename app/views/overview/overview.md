# Guide

### Welcome to the **Highway** to **Undercity**, an unforgettable summer of hardware running from now through July 31st.

If you've *never* done hardware before, this is *your* opportunity to get started. That one project you saw on YouTube but had no idea how to build? *That ends now.*

*If you're already a seasoned pro, this is your chance to really level up. That 5-axis 3D printer you've been thinking of? Now's your chance*.

**Earn points with each project you build.** Collect prizes along the way. Join your friends at Undercity, a 4 day hackathon in San Francisco at GitHub HQ.

*Don't forget to join the Hack Club Slack, our community. Need an invite? Enter your email on the [landing](/)!*

## Here's how it works:
---
### 1. Build hardware projects

#### 1. Pick an idea

Pick an idea! You can either choose a [Starter Project](/starter-projects) (4 points) or a [Custom Project](/advanced) (6 or 10 points)

[Starter Projects](/starter-projects) are guided resources that help you build awesome stuff like macropads just like the one below. In exchange, we'll ship you the parts you need to build it!

[Custom projects](/advanced) are fully self-directed! You'll be responsible for all the research, and in return, you'll get a debit card of up to $350* USD to spend on your project!

**by default you only get $150 USD, check out the [Custom Projects](/advanced) section to find out how you can get $350*

#### 2. Start your project 

Make a repository for your project! You can use any git provider, but most people use GitHub. Now, you can start making the PCB/CAD/code/more to your project!

**If you're making a Custom project:**

In the repository, create a file called JOURNAL.md - this will be where you keep track of your progress! Every single time you work on your project, you should jot down what you did and total hours spent. *Remember to commit the changes every time you work on it!*

**Before you work on your Custom project, make a pull request to add your project URL to the [submissions.yml](https://github.com/hackclub/highway/blob/main/submissions.yml) file in the Highway GitHub repo.**

It should look something like this:

```
projects:
  - "https://github.com/Dongathan-Jong/SpotifyDisplay"
  - "your_repo_link"
```
<br>
More instructions on the [Custom Projects](/advanced/overview) page!


#### 3. Ship the design
Shipping your design means sharing it in a way that other people can use what you made! Include the following:

- A published design on a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository
- A nice README.md file with a description of what your project does & any images
- Any source files that are used for your project

(*what you need specifically will change with each project, so make sure to double check the docs so that you have everything!*)

#### 4. Collect your points & parts
Once you have a shipped project, submit it to our form here: [https://forms.hackclub.com/highway](https://forms.hackclub.com/highway)

**If you get approved** you'll get the following; 

- Either a kit of parts (starter project), or a $350* credit card to build your design (custom project)!
- A 3D printed case (printed by another Hack Clubber in your country, if you don't have a 3D printer)
- A soldering kit, if you don't have one already

Approval is not guaranteed. Please go over the **submission requirements** of what you're making to make sure you don't get rejected!

Make sure to double check your design has everything you need before submitting! 

If it is rejected for any reason, you'll need to wait **1 week** before you can get it re-reviewed.

### 2. Join weekly events

Every week, we'll host events like Speedruns, Game Nights, AMAs, and Showcases! 

First one up is the **Kickoff call on Friday, May 23rd at 7:00PM EST**. Get your 1st point for free!

See the [Events](/events) tab for an up-to-date list.

---

### 3. Get invited to Undercity

Once you collect 12 points, AND you've physically built 1 project, you'll get invited to [Undercity](/getting-started/undercity), a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ from July 11-14.

It'll be filled to the *brim* with hardware - hundreds of microcontrollers, kilometers of cabling, and more 3D printing than you could ever need. (Did someone mention a PCB mill?)

## Ready. Set. Build!
