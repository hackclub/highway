# Overview

### Welcome to the **Highway** to **Undercity**, an unforgettable summer of hardware running from now through July 31st.

If you've *never* done hardware before, this is *your* opportunity to get started. That one project you saw on YouTube but had no idea how to build? *That ends now.*

**Earn points with each project you build.** Collect prizes along the way. Join your friends at Undercity, a 4 day hackathon in San Francisco at GitHub HQ.

*Don't forget to join the Hack Club Slack, our community. Need an invite? Enter your email on the [landing](/)!*

## Here's how it works:
---
### 1. Build hardware projects

Design & build hardware projects. You can either build fully [Custom Projecs](/advanced) (4/6/10 points) or [Starter Projects](/starter-projects) (4 points), or a mix of both!

[Starter Projects](/starter-projects) are existing Hack Club programs that teach you how to make one specific thing, i.e the macropad below. Design your own completely custom one, and we'll ship you the parts to build it.

[Custom projects](/advanced) are fully self-directed! You'll be responsible for all the research, and in return, you'll get a debit card of up to $350* USD to spend on your project! *You must journal your progress while working on custom projects*

(check out the top bar to see more about each path!)

**You can make an unlimited amount of projects, so get building!**

### 2. Join weekly events

Every week, we'll host events like Speedruns, Game Nights, AMAs, and Showcases! 

See the [Events](/events) tab for an up-to-date list.

---

### 3. Get invited to Undercity

Once you collect 12 points, AND you've physically built 1 project, you'll get invited to [Undercity](/getting-started/undercity), a 4 day hardware hackathon at GitHub HQ from July 11-14.

It'll be filled to the *brim* with hardware - hundreds of microcontrollers, kilometers of cabling, and more 3D printing than you could ever need. (Did someone mention a PCB mill?)

## Ready. Set. Build!
