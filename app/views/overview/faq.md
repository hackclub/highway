# FAQ

Welcome to the FAQ! This page attempts to point you to the right place when you have a question. It'll be constantly updated throughout the event as more questions get asked!

As always, if *anything* is unclear, ask in #highway for help!

### How can I get started with a custom project?
Read the [custom projects](/advanced) tab carefully. Everything is there.

### How are hours tracked?
For starter projects, they're not!

*For custom projects*, **you need to journal**. Please check out the [custom projects](/advanced) tab for more info on journaling!

### How will I get my 3D printed parts?
Through **printing legion**! It's an international network of Hack Clubbers 3D printing for each other, sponsored by Polymaker (website coming soon - hang tight!)

### How likely will is it that my project will be approved?

It's hard to say without seeing your project, but generally speaking, as long as you follow the guidelines on the submitting page for your project then you'll more likely than not get approved:

- Custom projects: https://highway.hackclub.com/advanced/submitting
- Hackpad: https://hackpad.hackclub.com/submitting

If you get rejected, don't fret! Edit your project, ask your peers in #highway for help, and then resubmit - most mistakes are very easy to fix

There is absolutely *no* limit to the number of projects we can accept - the more the better!

### How many projects can I make?

As many as you want! The funding is also *per* project, not per person. 

### Are group projects allowed for Highway?

Groups are allowed! Here's the deal though:

- Each person must journal & indicate what they did & how 
- Your grant is **per project**, not per person - even if you have 10 people, you're stuck with a max of 350 USd
- Points are split evenly among all of you, no exceptions

There is no cap to the amount of people you can have on a project, however in general I *strongly* advise having less than 2 people on a project. There's a lot of diminishing returns and unclear lines of responsibility that make it difficult to actually have the project.

### Can I submit an existing project I made?

If it's already finished, unfortunately not, sorry! Start a new proejct

If you've just started/are in the middle of designing, you need to have journaled the entire process beforehand

If you're almost done designing, unfortunately not.

### What's the minimum complexity for a custom project?

Check out the [Project Guidelines](/advanced/project-guidelines) in the Custom Projects section!

### Can I do Highway, but not go to Undercity?

Yup! This is for everyone, irrespective of whether or not they can come to Undercity.

(you should still totally come though if you can)

### Can points be used for something else?

Not as of right now. For those who get *above* 12 points, we *might* have some special swag planned. No promises.

### What if my project costs more than $350? Can I pay for the difference myself?
Yes!
