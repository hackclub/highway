# Starter projects!

**Starter projects** are existing Hack Club programs that are designed to help guide you along your hardware journey! 

They're called YSWSes, short for You Ship, We Ships. You ship a design, we'll ship you the parts!

**All of the parts will come straight from Hack Club HQ**, so you don't need to worry about sourcing or logistics. Just design & learn.

*Starter projects will automatically count for points once approved. Submission instructions are on their relative websites*
